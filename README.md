## How to Compile and Run
1. Make sure you have your files downloaded and a proper gcc/clang compiler.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and go to the directory the files are located in.
3. Then since we have a makefile, compile the file using: make fcfs, make rr, make priority to compile each file respectively.
4. Once the files have compiled, simply use: ./fcfs schedule.txt to run first come first serve scheduling.
5. Use: ./rr schedule.txt to run round robin scheduling.
6. Use ./priority schedule.txt to run priority scheduling.
7. The code will run for each command.
